# Squares

This project is a .NET application that provides functionality for calculating squares in a plane. It uses a list of points as input, each with an X and Y coordinate. The application calculates all possible squares that can be formed from these points.
The project uses LiteDB as a lightweight, serverless database for storing the points.
It also includes unit tests, using xUnit and NSubstitute for mocking dependencies.
